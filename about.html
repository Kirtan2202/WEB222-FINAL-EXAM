        <h2>Experience</h2>
<p>I recently took on the task of creating a website for a thrilling online game called SnakeMania. With my expertise in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and back-end technologies, I designed and implemented a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The website was designed to work smoothly across various devices and featured a dynamic and interactive Snake game, with different levels of difficulty, high scores, and options to share scores on social media.

    To enhance the user experience, I integrated sound effects, animations, and visual cues to provide feedback on game progress and actions, and implemented smooth transitions and animations. I also incorporated back-end technologies to handle game state management, player authentication, and high score tracking.
    
    Throughout the development process, I conducted thorough testing and incorporated feedback from playtesters to improve the game mechanics and overall performance. Building the SnakeMania game website was a challenging and exciting project that allowed me to showcase my web development skills and create an engaging gaming experience. I'm proud of the final result and eager to share it with gaming enthusiasts worldwide.</p>
